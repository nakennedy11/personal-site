For my first co-op, I was an intern for 6 months as part of End User Services at Bain Capital, providing general IT support for internal employees.
My main task each day was to take phone calls or chat sessions as they came in and try to resolve any issues that the user might have.
Outside of active calls I would work on ongoing issues, maintain deployed and available devices, and work with InfoSec or Desktop Engineering
with any tasks they could use a hand on.
