In 2019 I did a 6 month internship at Imprivata, an IT security company with a focus on health care organizations.
I worked as a Software Engineering Co-op on the Identity Governance team which deals with provisioning and administration of user accounts.
During my tenure there I worked mainly on two different projects. The first was overhauling the load testing of the product.
I assisted in switching from Visual Studio and Java based load testing to using Locust, an open source, distributed load testing tool
that uses Python to define the behavior of simulated users. I initially worked on implementing the tool, and extended its built in
data aggregation to more accurately reflect our testing scenarios. Then I helped convert load tests from the old format and into Python,
abstracting many of the scenarios in the process. After working on testing, I worked on a customer facing tool to upload their preexisting
accounts into the product. My project was to add more data logging of the accounts being uploaded through embedded SQL calls, and then
extend our UI to display these logs to the user. A big concern with this project was whether adding database calls to the tool would
cause too much of a runtime increase, but I was able to use threading to add in more robust logging without any significant detriment to
the end user.
